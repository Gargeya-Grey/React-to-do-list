# To-Do List Manager
This is a Simple to-do list that most of us are already familiar with.
You have a work to be completed in sometime, you can add that task in the to-do list so that you don't forget it. This also allows us to track what other tasks are to be done and which ones are completed.
Here is a demo screenshot of the  To-do List:
